Module 4:

Lesson 1 - Parallelization
I learned how to build workflows in LangGraph that use parallel execution (fan-out) to run multiple steps at the same time. I saw how state reducers like operator.add are essential to safely merge the results from those concurrent nodes back into a single state key (fan-in).

Chnages made: I modified the RAG example by adding a new rephrase_question node that pre-processes the user's initial query before it's simultaneously sent to the search_web and search_wikipedia nodes.
