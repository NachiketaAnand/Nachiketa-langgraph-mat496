Module 3

Video 1 - Streaming Interruptions
Streaming interruptions in LangGraph let you pause and inspect the agent while it’s running, so you can change inputs or control the flow in real time.

Changes made - I added a token counter and formatted output to keep track of how many streamed chunks were received. This helps me understand how the model sends partial responses in real time.”

Video 2 - Breakpoints
I learned that breakpoints let me stop the agent midway to inspect what it plans to do next. This helps me control its actions before allowing it to continue.

Changes made - I added more custom math functions like power and fibonacci to test the tool-calling feature.
The prompt message was updated to match the new functions.
